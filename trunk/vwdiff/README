This is the Visual Web Differ, or vwdiff.

Vwdiff is a utility for tracking the incremental changes of files that
exist on the internet. It periodically reads a list of URLs and compares
the data presented there with the data fetched earlier, then produces a
terse report of the apparent differences between these versions. The
report can be viewed via a minimal builtin web server with an ordinary
web browser.
