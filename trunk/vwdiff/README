This is the Visual Web Differencer, or vwdiff.

	Vwdiff is a utility for tracking the incremental changes of
files that exist on the internet. It periodically reads a list of URLs
and compares the data presented there with the data fetched earlier,
then produces a terse report of the apparent differences between these
versions. The report can be viewed via a minimal builtin web server with
an ordinary web browser.

	Why? Simply enough to provide a way to summarize how a
collection of web pages change over time, so one can, with a glance, see
if any favorite pages have any new content. And, since certain pages
make use of dynamic content, we calculate a percentage of data blocks
that are new, and get some idea of the newness of the page in question
by this percentage.

PREREQUISITES

	The only prerequisite is the Jarsync delta compression library,
available at http://jarsync.sourceforge.net/. Version 0.2 or later will
do.
